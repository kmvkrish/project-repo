# project-repo
A small application that stores and displays projects done by a user similar to Github.

This application will store all the projects uploaded by a user into the disk of server.

When browser for the folder of project like "project.php?url=<USERNAME OF UPLOADER>/<PROJECT NAME>" that will show a basic directory tree
    like we see in GitHub.
    
    
This is not much complicated as GitHub or GitLab or Atlasian BitBucket
